# Project Description

**Storage Client Webapp with Redundant Deals**: A web application and storage deal agent that supports users storing data redundantly with multiple miners. The app will track active storage deals and allow users to perform data retrieval.

**Value**: Currently Filecoin allows download of data only from the storage node where that data was uploaded to. This project proposes creating an extended upload system, which will allow a user to choose how many additional nodes they want to upload data to and a deal agent to execute redundant deals. This will increase the stability of the system through redundancy, but as a side effect, it will cost more for storage.
